<p>
This CMS project was built as part of my learning journey in PHP and the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern. 
While developing it, I used AI (ChatGPT) as a tool to assist with code structure, syntax, and problem-solving.</p>
<p>
Some code snippets were generated with AI support, but all parts of the code have been thoroughly reviewed, understood, and customized to fit the purpose of this application. 
The goal has always been to learn by doing â€” to understand how a CMS works under the hood and to write clean, maintainable code based on real-world concepts. 
This project reflects both my current skills and my commitment to growing as a developer.
